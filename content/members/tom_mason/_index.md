I am a conservation ecologist interested in how wild animal populations respond to changes in their environment, resulting both from natural processes and human activities. Environmental change can affect animal populations in complex and unexpected ways, from disturbing the behaviour of individuals to altering the distributions of species.  I collect and analyse ecological data in order to evaluate the drivers and dynamics of such processes. I am currently using behavioural-based models of bird migration to investigate how migratory journeys are likely to be influenced by environmental change.
