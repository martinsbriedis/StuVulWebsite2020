Animal migrations span the globe involving billions of individuals that along their journeys provide a multitude of services to our economy, agriculture and health. However, in the light of the ongoing global and climate change, many migrant populations have alarmingly declined over the past decades.
 
In this research project we aim at: 
1. Describing spatiotemporal migratory patterns of individual birds  
2. Investigating the role of environmental factors on migration performance   
3. Quantifying energetics of migration  
4. Identifying carry-over effects and their downstream consequences on migratory birds
  
To achieve this, we will combine full annual cycle tracking via novel multi-sensor geolocators with breeding and health status monitoring of indivdual birds.
  
  The project is carried out by the [University of Latvia Institute of Biology](http://lubi.lu.lv) in collaboration with the [Swiss Ornithological Institute](http://www.vogelwarte.ch). Funding is provided by the [Latvian Council of Science](https://www.lzp.gov.lv).
