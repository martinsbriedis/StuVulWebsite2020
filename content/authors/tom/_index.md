Tom is a conservation ecologist interested in how wild animal populations respond to changes in their environment. He works as a post-doctoral researcher within the Bird Migration Department of the Swiss Ornithological Institute. Within GloBAM, Tom will focus on developing spatial models of bird migration to explore how migratory journeys will be affected by global environmental change.
